This is a basic staking dapp project, which is written in Solidity and React. Solidity is used to write smart contracts for the backend, and React JS is used for the client-side or frontend.

The definition of staking can vary depending on the project, but in simple language, you provide some amount of tokens to a platform for a certain duration, and the platform gives you some reward tokens after the specified duration based on the set percentage.

However, staking can be used in multiple ways. For example, if you want to create a voting functionality, you can use token staking in voting. For security purposes, you can create a token that only those who hold the token can stake and vote.

In this staking dapp, the basic concept of staking is used. Staking means that someone locks their tokens or cryptocurrency on a platform for a certain period of time, and in exchange, they receive some reward tokens when the time period is complete.

Staking tokens can be of any type, native or utility (using ERC tokens). Multiple platforms provide support for multiple tokens, and then the platform can use your tokens for their work as long as the staking period lasts. In exchange, platforms also give some rewards, whether they are their own platform's tokens or your tokens.

## Conclusion:

Staking is used in many different ways on various platforms, and it depends on the platform's needs how you use staking. You just need to understand the terminology of the staking word and how it works.
